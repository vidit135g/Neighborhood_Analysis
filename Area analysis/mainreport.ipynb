We will also try to focus on the crime rates of the particular area, roads, weather and availability of resources.

    "Clustering Approach:\n",
    "To compare the similarities of two cities, we decided to explore neighborhoods, segment them, and group them into clusters to find similar neighborhoods in a big city like New York and Toronto. To be able to do that, we need to cluster data which is a form of unsupervised machine learning: k-means clustering algorithm.\n",

    "\n",
    "Using credentials of Foursquare API features of near-by places of the neighborhoods would be mined. Due to http request limitations the number of places per neighborhood parameter would reasonably be set to 100 and the radius parameter would be set to 500.\n",

    "Being an administartive division of Toronto, Scarborough is a popular destination for immigrants. Scarborough is a popular destination for new immigrants in Canada to reside. As a result, it is one of the most diverse and multicultural areas in the Greater Toronto Area, being home to various religious groups and places of worship. It includes a number of natural landmarks, including the Toronto Zoo, Rouge Park and the Scarborough Bluffs. The northeast corner of Scarborough is largely rural with some of Toronto’s last remaining farms, earning Scarborough its reputation of being greener than any other part of Toronto.\n",

    "There are so many migrants in different states of Canada who had to settle themselves for which they had to do a lot of research. The research here comprises of good prices for housing, good schools, best places to buy grocery etc. This project is for those people who are looking for the best places and the best availabilities within an area.

    "\n",
    "Using the K-means algorithm I separated the neighborhood into ten different clusters. Using the charts given, we can clearly conclude the right rating for avg school rating and the house prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "I feel that completing all of the courses helped me learn a lot of new things which I didn't even had the clue about. This project has helped me to learn about various applications of data science in practical life. Tools such as Folium, numpy, pandas and nominatim are extremely useful to make the task less complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Future scope\n",
    "\n",
    "This is just a beginning, as a lot of more features can be integrated to this project. Not just avg. housing prices and school rates, we can also add other broad categories as well, some of them are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Popular areas for nightlife.\n",
    "Nearest government hospitals.\n",
    "Popular areas for car washing.\n",
    "\n",
    "and the list goes on.\n",
